# Neovim Starter

Base configuration for Neovim. For those looking to make Neovim their new main editor. Here you'll find a popular combination of plugin to make your experience a little bit better.

A few things have been configured to resemble other modern text editors. You'll find a file explorer with tree style view, list open files in tabs, git integration and a terminal easy to toggle.

Autocompletion and "code intellisense" is provided by the LSP client built into Neovim. The following language servers are configured:

* tsserver
* eslint
* cssls
* html

Most of the code in this configuration is explained in this series:

* [Build your first Neovim configuration in lua](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/build-your-first-lua-config-for-neovim/)
* [Neovim: Plugins to get started](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/neovim-plugins-to-get-started/)
* [Setup nvim-lspconfig + nvim-cmp](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/setup-nvim-lspconfig-plus-nvim-cmp/)

## Requirements

* Neovim v0.8 or greater.
* git.
* A `C` compiler. Can be `gcc`, `tcc` or `zig`.
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the build tool.
* [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm). Javascript package manager.
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es/). Javascript runtime. Required by the language servers listed above.
* (optional) [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Improves project wide search speed.
* (optional) [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd). Improves file search speed.
* (optional) A patched font to display icons. I hear [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) has a good collection.

> Here's the config [compatible with v0.7](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/4e7ccba7e69182f3dc1ee2f27be66677118c35b6). 

## Installation

* Backup your existing configuration if you have one.

* If you don't know the path of the Neovim configuration folder use this command.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'echo stdpath("config") | quit'
```

* Now clone this repository in that location.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter /tmp/nvim-config-path
```

> Do not execute this command as is. Replace `/tmp/nvim-config-path` with the correct path from the previous step.

* Move to the configuration folder where you clone the repository. Change branch to `05-modular`.

```sh
git checkout 05-modular
```

* Next time you start Neovim all plugins will be downloaded automatically. After this process is done `nvim-treesitter` will install language parsers for treesitter. And, `mason.nvim` will download language servers listed in the configuration. Use the command `:Mason` to check the download process of language servers.
